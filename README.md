Because, it allows the markov to be pretty smart and coherent!

BasinMarkov is a disk based, custom markov designed to be super smart and coherent. it is designed to compete with LLMs. funny though, this was coded by two LLMs.

BasinMarkov is an experimental markov model. it is not acctually designed to compete with llms, it just designed to be a fun markov toy. (This is a project that was coded with an llm, due to the complexitity of this project.)

This project is also designed to see how amazing markov models can be and just how powerful they can be as chatbots.

Have fun!

Pretrained BasinMarkov will be in releases. check releases for the pretrained model.
