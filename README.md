Why BasinMarkov?

Because, it allows the markov to be pretty smart and coherent!

BasinMarkov is a disk based, custom markov designed to be super smart and coherent. it is designed to compete with LLMs. funny though, this was coded by two LLMs.

BasinMarkov is an experimental markov model. it is not acctually designed to compete with llms, it just designed to be a fun markov toy. (This is a project that was coded with an llm, due to the complexitity of this project.)

This project is also designed to see how amazing markov models can be and just how powerful they can be as chatbots.

Have fun!

Pretrained BasinMarkov will be in releases. check releases for the pretrained model.

before running, make sure you have python3, python3-pip, zlib from pip and sqlite3 from pip installed. install via this command:

pip install sqlite3 zlib

you can get python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

python3-pip, python3 is only needed for linux/macos/unix. windows installer autoinstalls pip.

you can also optionally get python-is-python3 where you don't have to type python3 but rather python. it is not required but just for convience and preference.
